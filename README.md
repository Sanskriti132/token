SimToken: A Basic Token Contract for Minting and Burning
Description:SimToken is a Solidity-based smart contract developed on the Ethereum network. 
For minting and burning tokens, it offers basic functionality. Users can learn the fundamentals of token administration in a decentralized setting with the aid of this contract.
GETTING STARTED:A straightforward Solidity token contract is called SimToken. It has public variables to hold the name, abbreviation, and total quantity of tokens, among other important token data. 
A mapping to monitor each address's balance is included in the contract. Tokens can be burned to lower the total supply and balance or minted again to enhance the total supply and balance.
The contract is perfect for instructional purposes or as a basis for more intricate token systems, as it illustrates straightforward yet efficient techniques for controlling a token's lifetime on a blockchain.
